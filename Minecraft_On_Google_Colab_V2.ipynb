        "While Google Colab is not made for hosting Minecraft servers. Its is possible to set one up. Here are some things to take away from this:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Session Duration**: Google Colab sessions can run for up to 82 hours! but they might turn off the server if the page is inactive for a really long time! To keep your server running (so you players won't be annoyed!) you have to keep your server tab open as much as possible or you can download the colab alive extension!\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Performance Specs**: Google Colab provides around **12 GB** of RAM, a 2.2 GHz processor with 2 threads, which can outperform many paid hosting services. However, it lacks any support from google, so if anything goes wrong you're on your own!\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Mod and Plugin Limitations**: While you can install mods and plugins, itโs advisied to **not** overload the server with too many! As this can impact performance! To reduce this lag try to install a plugin like [LightOptimizer](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/lightoptimizer-%E2%9A%A1-server-performance-booster-fps-helper-%E2%9A%A1.117477/) or a modpack like [1.21 Server Optimizations](https://modrinth.com/collection/YnSBBMnH)\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Best Use Cases**: If youโre planning to make a small Minecraft server for a few players or a smp (btw call it the colab smp XD) this is the perfect option! But, if you are thinking of making a server with more players, i'd recommend you to either buy a server or self host it on an old computer or cheap computer them you upgrade it to make it possible to host a server!.\n"
